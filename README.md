# Audio & Music Processing Lab

[Music Information Retrieval (MIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval) is a rapidly expanding field of study highlighting the intersections of music and computing. Enclosed in this repository is a compliation of programs that accomplish various MIR-related tasks and excersizes. They were written during my time as a graduate student with the Music Technology Group (MTG) at Pompeu Fabra, and as result many of these notebooks interface with MTG technologies and datasets. Each notebook should provide the necessary tools (or atleast links to said tools) in order to successfully reproduce the work as detailed.

#### Acoustic Brainz Duplicates Analysis
[AcousticBrainz (AB)](https://acousticbrainz.org) is an open source database that houses extracted music information data for over [3 million (!!)](https://acousticbrainz.org/statistics-graph) songs. AB does not store the analyzed audio files on its servers due to the vastness of the its library and the copyright complications associated with doing so. Therefore AB relies on a community of enthusiasts to contribute to their database while not having direct access to analyzed audio. Considering that every community members music library is likely to have some overlapping similarities, each song can have many duplicate submissions on the AB database. This program looks over those duplicates to try and identify candidates for having been mislabeled.
